				<h2 class="question closed h5">Why is water planning important to South Carolina citizens?</h2>
					<p class="answer">Water is a critical, but limited natural resource, and is a major factor for economic development and environmental protection. An adequate amount of water for domestic use, agriculture, power generation, industry, commerce, and fish and wildlife is essential to the health, safety, and welfare of every Palmetto State citizen, as well as for future generations.</p>
				<h2 class="question closed h5">What is the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources’ role in state water planning?</h2>
					<p class="answer">State legislation charges the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR) with developing a comprehensive water resource policy or Water Plan for the State.  However, SCDNR recognizes the effective management of South Carolina’s water resources is beyond the scope of any one agency or organization and requires cooperation and shared responsibility among federal, State, and local agencies, as well as public and private stakeholders.</p>
				<h2 class="question closed h5">What is the new State Water Planning Framework?</h2>
					<p class="answer">The last State Water Plan was published in 2004; and though the Plan was never formally adopted by the General Assembly, the Plan recommended water management plans be developed for the major river basins in the State. The new State Water Planning Framework provides detailed guidance on the development of such water management plans, now formally called River Basin Plans, for the eight major river basins, or planning basins, in the State. A key component of the new framework is the establishment of a stakeholder-led council (River Basin Council) working together to develop each of the River Basin Plans. The eight River Basin Plans, once completed, will form the foundation of a new State Water Plan which will summarize the findings and recommendations developed in the individual plans.</p>
				<h2 class="question closed h5">How was the State Water Planning Framework developed?</h2>
					<p class="answer">SCDNR developed the Planning Framework under the guidance of the State Water Planning Process Advisory Committee (PPAC). The PPAC was convened by SCDNR in March 2018 to encourage stakeholder participation and to obtain perspectives from a diverse range of stakeholders with water-related interests in the State. The Planning Framework was completed in October 2019 and is documented in a report, South Carolina State Water Planning Framework, available on the SCDNR website.</p>
				<h2 class="question closed h5">Who are members of the PPAC?</h2>
					<p class="answer">The PPAC consists of a <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/public/water-assessment/State_Water_Planning_Process_Advisory_Committee.html#PPAC" target="_blank">diverse group of 19 stakeholders</a> with water-related interests and expertise in the State. The PPAC includes representatives from public water supply, power companies, agriculture, trade, conservation organizations, State agencies, and academia.</p>
				<h2 class="question closed h5">What is a planning basin and why are there eight planning basins?</h2>
					<p class="answer">A planning basin defines the geographic area considered by a River Basin Plan.  The eight planning basins correspond to the eight major river basins in the State (Broad, Edisto, Catawba, Pee Dee, Salkehatchie, Saluda, Santee, and Savannah). Each planning basin is unique, and individual River Basin Plans are needed to address basin-specific water resources and challenges.</p>
				<h2 class="question closed h5">What is a River Basin Plan?</h2>
					<p class="answer">A River Basin Plan is a collection of water management strategies designed to ensure the surface and groundwater resources of a river basin will be available for all uses for years to come, even under drought conditions. The plans will be developed for a 50-year planning horizon and will be supported by a set of hydrologic models that incorporate current water use, current permitted and registered water use, and projected water use to assess current and future water availability. River Basin Plans also will include policy, legislative, regulatory, technical, and planning process recommendations regarding the State’s water resources.</p>
				<h2 class="question closed h5">How will the River Basin Plans be used to develop a new statewide water plan?</h2>
					<p class="answer">The eight River Basin Plans, once completed, will form the foundation of the new State Water Plan. The new State Water Plan, prepared by SCDNR, will be a compilation of key information from the River Basin Plans and will summarize and prioritize water policy, regulatory, and legislative recommendations.</p>
				<h2 class="question closed h5">What is the purpose of the recently announced meetings in Blackville and St. George about water planning in the Edisto River Basin?</h2>
					<p class="answer">Now that the PPAC has completed work on the Planning Framework document, the next phase of this process involves setting up stakeholder-led councils (River Basin Councils) that will create River Basin Plans for each of South Carolina’s eight planning basins. The Edisto River Basin has been selected as the first basin in the planning process. The other seven basins will follow as funding becomes available. The meetings in Blackville and St. George will showcase the new State Water Planning Framework and engage stakeholders in the Edisto River Basin.</p>
				<h2 class="question closed h5">How will members of the public be able to get involved?</h2>
					<p class="answer">The public meetings scheduled for the Edisto basin will be the first opportunity for members of the public to come and learn what the Planning Framework document contains and to ask questions of SCDNR and the PPAC members. The meetings also will provide opportunities to identify members of the community interested in serving on the Edisto River Basin Council, a working group of stakeholders with water interests in the basin. In addition, River Basin Council meetings will be open to the public and include a public comment period. The public also will have the opportunity to review and submit comments on draft River Basin Plans once developed.</p>
				<h2 class="question closed h5">South Carolina historically seems to have had plenty of rainfall and parts of the State have even experienced severe flooding over the last five years. So why is water planning such a big deal now?</h2>
					<p class="answer">Water use and planning issues tend to draw more attention during periods of extreme drought, such as our state experienced in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but planning for water use should be a priority at all times. If we wait for the next drought to begin thinking through these issues, it will be too late to make a difference.  River Basin Plans and the new State Water Plan will be used to guide water resource management in our state for the next fifty years. During that time, we may experience periods of drought, or periods of higher-than normal rainfall. The important thing is to have a plan in place that anticipates various conditions we might see in the future.</p>
